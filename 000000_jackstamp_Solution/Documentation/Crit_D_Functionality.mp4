This is a placeholder text file describing the screen recording script for Criterion D.
Record a 5-minute video with the following flow:
1. Begin by showing the six agreed success criteria from Crit_A_Planning.pdf.
2. Launch the CLI (`python3 -m src.main`).
3. Demonstrate option 1 by entering a new profile with mixed equipment and confirm the JSON file contents.
4. Demonstrate option 2 by generating a plan for that user, scrolling through each day and narrating how the split meets the goal.
5. Open `data/plans.json` to prove persistence, then close and reopen the program and show the plan is still stored.
6. Attempt to enter an invalid user id to show the graceful error message.
Replace this placeholder with the final MP4 recording before submission.
